# Reachy's Alim board
This repository contains the KiCad project of the board used de separate a 12V input in several outputs to provide 12V to the different parts of Reachy.

The five 12V outputs are connected to a switch to choose if they provide 12V or not.

There are holes to solder a 12V-5V converter for Raspberry Pi. There is a switch between the 12V input and these holes to choose if we want to supply the Raspberry or not.
